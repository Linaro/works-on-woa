Welcome to Works on Windows on Arm! 

This site is your source for compatibility information for many apps and games on Windows devices that run on Arm architecture and will be updated over time. 

For more information on how we define compatible and how to navigate the site, refer to the [help page](/help).

If you have tested apps or games and want to contribute your own results, please read the [contributing guide](/contributing) to help you to submit a Pull Request to the open source repository on GitHub.

The information is intended to serve as a guide, but does not absolutely guarantee that a game will run. The results have been tested, but may not work on your specific machine and configuration. If your results differ, please contribute to the site with your own findings.
