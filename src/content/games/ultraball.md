compatibility_details: "Runs, in fullscreen and everything despite the ancient method it uses to achieve fullscreen, but the background music is hellishly crackly, with everything besides the crackling being quiet. Sound effects seem fine, though. Sure, this problem's also present on the x86 version of W11, but nowhere near as bad as it is here on ARM (though testing in an XP VM has proven that the cracking isn't supposed to be there at all). However, there's a far worse problem on WoA: the paddle's collision is really wonky on ARM, such that it's very common for the ball to simply phase right through it. Given that this is a breakout-style game, that's an ENORMOUS problem."
