name: "Fallout 3"
categories: [roleplaying]
publisher: Bethesda 
compatibility: perfect
device_configuration: Snapdragon 8cx -8gb
date_tested: 2024-10-22
os_version: "23h2"
compatibility_details: "The game runs at 60+ fps but you need to use the intel HD mod (just a direct x 9 dll for tricking the system) since the game can't detect integrated graphics on all systems either intel or amd. Once you have put that you can play the game either on steam or the gog version. For controller support just search the disabled launcher guide and it should just be typing a no launcher line on steam or on the exe if you have the gog version."
