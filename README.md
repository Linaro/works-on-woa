# "Works on Windows on Arm" website git repository

This repository is used to build `staging.worksonwoa.com` and, from there, `www.worksonwoa.com`.

The websites are built automatically when the staging and main branches are updated, as appropriate.

The staging branch is updated by:

- Forking this repository
- Making the changes you want to make
- Raising a pull request against the staging branch
- Waiting for a repository maintainer to review and approve your changes

Once the pull request is approved, your changes will be merged to the staging branch and published to staging.worksonwoa.com.

A repository maintainer can then merge all changes from staging to main in order to cause the main website to be updated and rebuilt.
